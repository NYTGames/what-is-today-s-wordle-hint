## About Wordle

Wordle is a word-guessing game where players have six chances to guess a five-letter word. Each guess provides feedback in the form of colored tiles indicating correct letters in the correct position (green) and correct letters in the wrong position (yellow).

Our goal is to help players improve their strategies and provide tips to solve the puzzle efficiently.
